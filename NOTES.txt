We're going with Rails 4.1, and Ruby 2.1 as this is what Audioboom use
Also Rspec, not sure which gem version they use but we're going with 3.2

Ignoring certain files by editing: .git/info/exclude

Install bundle with binstubs flag. This creates stubs in ./bin folder, ensuring the right version gets used. This may mean we don't need bundle exec anymore
> bundle install --binstubs

TODO: look at adding ./bin to so we don't have to call bin/rake etc.

Initialised project to use RSpec
> bin/rspec --init




TODO: checkout official docs - https://relishapp.com/rspec/

RSpec Notes
-----------

From http://rspec.info/

All tests (specs) are expected to go in a folder called ./spec/

Run your specs (tests)
> bin/rspec
> bin/rspec --format doc | gives you enhanced output.
